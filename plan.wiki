  * [ ] Create a longer term data set
  * [ ] Add a test to the test file
  * [ ] Feed the data into the long term tracker
  * [ ] Set the range so 365 days
  * [ ] Try to graph it, to see if it makes sense
  * [ ] Iterate the design to accommodate shortcomings discerned from this
        testing

  *What defines Success?*
    * [X] The range in the plots is exactly what is asked for.
    * [X] The stickleback plots were fixed to match the accurate prediction plots.
    * [X] The stickleback plots schedule drops are now all populated.
    * [X] The code is much much faster than it was.
    * [X] Find out what we are controlling anyway, write it up.
    * [X] Reduce the number of samples, and increase it's speed of execution.
    * [X] That plasticity function is learned over time so that it can be transported
          to the next training item.
    * [ ] There is a single interface, instead of 3-4 interfaces as there was before.
    * [ ] Create something where you just add the results of a new lesson
    * [ ] Spaced was turned into a python package and shipped.
    
  *What is the problem?*
    If you look at the spaced_predict.pdf file, you see that the last orange
    line does not drop.

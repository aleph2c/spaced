  *What defines Success?*
    [ ] * The range in the plots is exactly what is asked for.
    [ ] * The offset/timedate plots are easy to select from.
    [ ] * The stickleback plots were fixed to match the accurate prediction plots.
    [ ] * The stickleback plots schedule drops are now all populated.
    [ ] * That plasticity function is learned over time so that it can be transported
          to the next training item.
    [ ] * There is a single interface, instead of 3/4 interfaces as there was before.
    [ ] * The code is much much faster than it was.
    [ ] * Spaced was turned into a python package and shipped.

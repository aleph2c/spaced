<p>To see the graph from which this schedule was derived:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">hdl</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">lt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">reference</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">plot_graph</span><span class="p">()</span>

</a>
<p>The graph’s x-axis represents time while the y-axis represents the amount a
student can remember about the thing they are trying to learn. The student has
perfectly remembered an idea if its score is one and they have utterly forgotten
an idea if its score is zero.</p>
<p>The red stickleback looking graph represents how a students recollection ability
will rise and fall as a function of training events and the passage of time from
a given training event. At first, a student forgets something quickly, but as
they train on an idea, that idea will fade slower from their memory. The sudden
vertical-rise of this red line represents a moment when the student studies.
There is an assumption that they will review an idea long enough that their
immediate recollection of that idea will be perfect before they stop thinking
about it.</p>
<p>The blue line maps to plasticity, or how fast an idea can be mapped into a mind
as a function over time.  It can be thought of as representing how memories form
over the long term.</p>
<p>The training events occur where the forgetting curves of the stickleback
approach the plasticity line. At each intersection of the forgetting curve and
the plasticity curve, orange lines are projected downward to the x-axis to
provide the suggested times of study. Collectively, these times are called the
schedule.</p>

<span id="quickstart-adding-student-feedback"></span><h2>Adding Student Feedback<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-student-feedback" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To begin with the schedule is completely arbitrary.  This is because the model
doesn’t understand anything about the student yet.  But each time you give it
student data it adapts its schedule to the student’s behavior, and how they
appear to be forgetting things.</p>
<p>Imagine that immediately after looking at the material for the first time; our
student tries to remember what they just learned.  They determine that they can
recall about 40 percent of the material.  To tell <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spaced</span></code> about this, we
would write the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">days_since_training_epoch</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="n">lt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">learned</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mf">0.4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">when</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">days_since_training_epoch</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Immediately after finishing their test, the student reviews the material until
they understand all of it.</p>
<p>Suppose that 19 hours later (0.8 days later), the student tests themselves
again.  This time they can remember 44 percent of it.  Let’s feed this into the
learning tracker, by writing the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">days_since_training_epoch</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.8</span>

<p>As before, the student reviews the material after they have tested themselves.</p>

<p>It is different than it was when we started.  We can ask the learning tracker
for a plot so we can see where these datetime values are coming from:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">hdl</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">lt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">plot_graphs</span><span class="p">()</span>

<p>The diagram above contains four different graphs.  The first graph is called the
recommendation.  It represents the goal of our training engagement with this
student for the thing that they are trying to learn.  It is exactly the same as
the reference graph we plotted above.</p>
<p>The 2nd graph represents the observed data that the student has given us.  At
time zero they could remember 40 percent of an idea after their initial
training session.  They retrained, then retested themselves 0.8 days later and
got 44 percent. Then they retrained again.  The light blue line on the observed
curve is an analogue to the dark blue line on the recommendation curve.  It is
a plasticity curve, but unlike the reference-plasticity curve in the
recommendation graph, the observed-plasticity curve is discovered by fitting a
line to the data provided as feedback from the student.  It is describing how a
long term memory is actually forming in the student’s mind, not how we wish it
would be formed (represented by the dark blue line in the recommendation graph).</p>
<p>The 3rd graph down the page, labeled “error signal” is the difference between
what we want and what we got.  Specifically it is the difference between the
recommendation graphs plasticity curve and the observed plasticity curve (the
dark blue line in the first graph minus the light blue graph in the second graph).
The y-axis of this plot can be positive, if a memory isn’t forming as fast as we
want, or negative, if the student is studying too much or doesn’t really forget
things; causing a memory to form faster than our recommendation.</p>
<p>The final graph, the 4th graph, is labeled “control”.  This is because it
describes how the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spaced</span></code> algorithm tries to drive its error signal to zero
by controlling the world in the only way it can: by shifting its schedule
recommendations.  It does this in two ways, it tunes the forgetting curves (the
red stickleback lines) to match how a student actually forgets things and it
finds the intersection between the observed plasticity curve and the
reference-plasticity curve, then redraws the updated-forgetting-stickleback on
the reference-plasticity curve at this intersection point.</p>

<p>This last graph really isn’t that useful: the next recommended training date
isn’t on its control plot.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s hard to get a clear idea about what is going on by looking at any
of these plots, since you really have to see the graph from the previous
feedback event, to understand the current context.  What would be nice would be
an animation of each training event followed by the next.  You could watch it
for 10 seconds and get a good idea about their training history.</p>

<p>If you were to write this code, the results of this session would be used to
make a video in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">results/report_card.mp4</span></code>.  That video would look something like this:</p>
<center>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H8llYuwH5L0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center><p>As you play the video, you see a story unfold about the relationship between our
model and the student’s reaction to it. In the first five days of their
training, we see that they made more mistakes than we would have liked, then,
around the seventh day, something clicks for them, and they do better than what
was predicted by the original model.</p>
<p>We can see that the control system tried to get them to do much more training
when they were doing poorly, and less training when they started to understand
the material. When the dark blue reference curve in the control box moved to the
left, the student was doing better than expected, and when it shifted to the
right, the student was doing worse than expected.</p>
<p>We also see that our initial forgetting curves were too pessimistic, and as a
result our initial schedule was too aggressive. But after a few training events,
the spaced algorithm began to match the forgetting parameters to how the student
actually forgot things.</p>
<p>The video plays a training event every second, which means that we are
accelerating time since the training events become more and more spaced out the
later they occur.</p>

<p>But, it is unlikely that you will be using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spaced</span></code> to track just one object.  You
will probably have thousands of them running, and you will have to select from a
small subset of these thousands of tracked objects to compile a review session for your
student.  To do this, you need to know which of your tracked <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spaced</span></code> objects
are in the most need of attention.</p>
<p>For this reason you will need to query a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spaced</span></code> object so that it can make a

a result, you can use the learning tracker’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">predict_result</span></code> api.</p>

</a>
<p>You can see when we plot a set of queries for the results of the first learning
curve over a set of datetimes, that the line representing this information
extends downward past the plasticity line.  This is because the query assumes
that no additional training event will occur.</p>

<p>As the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spaced</span></code> algorithm reacts to the student’s feedback, it gets a much
better idea about how the student forgets information and how they remember
things over the long term.  It does this by changing the tuning parameters for
the control-forgetting-curves and the observed-plasticity-curve.</p>
<p>Now imagine if we used these discovered parameters to create a realistic recommendation
graph.  We could create a model which is fit to their previous behavior.  If the
student was having a harder time, the initial scheduling goal would become more aggressive,
patiently presenting the information over and over until the student gained the foothold
they needed.</p>
<p>If the student was very strong, the schedule would become more sparse, avoiding
the risk of boring the student.</p>
<p>We can build a better model, even without understanding what the model building
parameter mean.  We can do by feeding the discovered the discovered parameters
from one full-training session into the beginning of another.</p>
